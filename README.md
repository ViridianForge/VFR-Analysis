# VFR-Analysis
A collection of the various datasets I've written R scripts to look over.

#Chiptune Artist Density Map
This was a little experiment using ChipMama Erin McQuisten's ChipWIN artist map.  The artists were broken
down by country of origin, and then mapped using RWorldMap.  This is a project I'll hopefully update on occasion
as Chiptunes=WIN gets new submissions to their Artist list.

#CollegeCosts
This project was inspired by a comment on Reddit.  I wanted to express the cost of college over time, 
adjusted for inflation, in terms of hours of inflation adjusted federal minimum wage labor.
